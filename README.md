A simple python program that detects manga chapters based on file names (c001/d1000) and automatically creates a basic ComicInfo.xml file with bookmarks for each detected chapter.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3 must be installed on the system
- manga files must be extracted
- images can all be in one folder or in several subfolders (only file names are checked, not folder names)

How to use:
- go into the root of the volume folder that contains all the images (ex: "Two Pieces v01") and open a command prompt (aka cmd)
- enter "python ", drag and drop the manga_comicinfo.py file onto the cmd window and hit return
